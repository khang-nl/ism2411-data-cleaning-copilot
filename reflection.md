1. What CoPilot generated
Though importing libraries and the basic cleaning function were created by me, very specific modifications to the data were done by Copilot. I utilized comments to modify the various factors that were present in the raw data, such as capitalization, missing values, etc. It was most useful when the raw data had no perfect row, and that it was required multiple rows were aggregated to produce a clean output.
2. What you modified
Copilot's code worked often. When there was an error, it was able to apply a fix itself competently. I had to steer its target often however, such as renaming the variables in its code to match the rest of the program; the code itself is usually functional, but it had to be made compatible with the rest of the program.
3. What you learned
Cleaning data with pandas was always a sort of weak spot for me. Copilot was competent enough however that when I used it, I could learn more about how to clean data better from its output. For example, many products were missing when I only filtered incorrect values, and I was confused. When I checked the raw data, I saw many products did not have an entry at all due to none of the rows passing the checks I implemented. With Copilot, I learned how you had to aggregate different values from different rows on the same product to produce a single clean output that can be put into the final version of the cleaned data
