## Sales Data Processor
This program cleans raw sales data by filtering invalid values and extracting the correct values from redundant rows. This gets rid of errors in the data, and gives a much more accurate perspective of sales to the user. Accounts for a variety of unique possible errors in raw data.

## How To Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. From your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python app.py
# or
python3 app.py
```

Ensure you have a file named "sales_data_raw.csv" located in data/raw.
